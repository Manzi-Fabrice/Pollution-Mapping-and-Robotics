# Pollution-Mapping-and-Robotics

This project focuses on monitoring an area and taking accurate measurements using a robotic system. The primary objectives are:

Accurate Measurement Collection: Ensure all hotspots with values above a given threshold are explored and measured. 

Efficient Resource Utilization: Decide when and where to deploy sensors to maximize measurement accuracy while minimizing resource use.
